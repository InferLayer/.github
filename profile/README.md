# InferLayer - identifying gen-AI code origin
Highlighting AI-generated code in VSCode as a part of bigger event processing InferLayer system for identification of content origins (AI-generated or not).

## About
Currently a lot of gen-AI content is generated by tons of gen-AI tools and services. It includes many kinds of data: text, images, video streams, object data, etc. Besides of good things (getting human readable gen-AI content in miliseconds and speeding up our daily work like writing business documents and program code), the generated content is trained and i.e. "based" on other third-party content belonging to others. Furthermore, untrusted content used accidently in AI-model trainings may lead to distortion of truthfulness of generated data. There are initiatives like C2PA to markup gen-AI data by responsible providers but most of generated data isn't tagged. All of this can lead companies using AI-assistants or gen-AI content to copyright infringement cases or unreliable information usage.
Here in InferLayer we are building the system identifying origins of the used content and marking the gen-AI content that people can recheck AI-gen parts of their documents and code to avoid copyright infringement cases or untrusty information usage.
